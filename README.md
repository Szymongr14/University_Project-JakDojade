# Shortest Path Finder for a Map with Cities and Flight Connections

This project was created as part of my Algorithm and Data Structure course, where I was tasked with implementing various data structures without the use of the STL library. Program finds the shortest path between two cities on a rectangular map divided into squares. Each square can be empty, part of a road, or a city. Some cities have one-way air connections to other cities. The program uses the Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path.

## Features
 - Supports multiple queries for the shortest travel time between two cities.
 - Can also output the intermediate cities in the order they were visited.
 - Uses custom implementations of string, linked list, vector, queue, and hash map data structures.
 - Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to create a graph from the given map.
 - Includes a sample input file (input.in) and a sample output file (output.out) for testing.
